# SDE Intern Assignment: Shared Bill Splitter

Welcome. In this assignment you build a small bill splitter for a shared home. It has two parts:

1. **Homes and members:** create a home and add members to it.
2. **Bill splitting:** split a bill between the members. Each member pays their own share.

The assignment is small on purpose. We want correct, safe, and clear code. We do not want many features.

## What we look at

- **Your code passes the tests.** The tests decide, not opinion. You get the visible tests. We also run extra tests that you do not see.
- **Your code is safe when things go wrong.** Wrong input, repeated requests, and two requests at the same time must not break your data.
- **Your code is typed.** Use TypeScript. Do not use `any`.
- **You understand your code.** You record a short video and explain it.

Take your time. A careful, correct solution is better than a fast one. We expect 2 to 3 days of real work.

## Stack (required)

- **API:** Hono on Cloudflare Workers
- **Database:** Cloudflare D1 (SQLite). The binding is `DB` in `api/wrangler.jsonc`.
- **Web:** React, Vite, TanStack Router
- **Language:** TypeScript on both sides
- **Tests:** Vitest, running inside the Workers runtime
- **Quality:** Biome. `pnpm check` and `pnpm typecheck` must pass.

You choose the rest (styling, form library, validation library). Pick tools you can explain.

## The task

The assignment has two parts. Do Part 1 first. Part 2 builds on it.

**Database.** Write the schema as SQL migration files in `api/migrations/`. For example `0001_init.sql`. The tests apply every file in this folder. Your schema must have **at least 3 named constraints** that protect the data. For example a foreign key, a `CHECK`, or a `UNIQUE` key. Be ready to explain what each constraint stops.

**Errors.** Every error response is JSON: `{ "error": "message" }`.

## Part 1: Homes and members

Create a home and add members to it. The order in which members are added matters in Part 2.

#### `POST /api/homes`

- Request: `{ "name": string }`
- Success: `201` `{ id, name }`

#### `POST /api/homes/:homeId/members`

- Request: `{ "name": string }`
- Success: `201` `{ id, homeId, name }`
- Errors: `404` home not found

Visible tests: `api/test/homes.test.ts`.

## Part 2: Bill splitting

Add a bill to a home, split it between the members, and let each member pay their share.

All amounts are whole **cents** (integers). `100` cents is 1 dollar. Never use decimals for money.

#### `POST /api/homes/:homeId/bills`

- Request: `{ "title": string, "totalCents": number }`
- Success: `201` `{ id, homeId, title, totalCents, shares: [{ id, memberId, amountCents, paidAt: null }] }`
- Errors: `404` home not found. `422` total is not a positive whole number, or the home has no members.

#### `POST /api/bills/:billId/shares/:shareId/pay`

- Request: header `Idempotency-Key`
- Success: `200` `{ id, memberId, amountCents, paidAt }`
- Errors: `400` key missing. `404` bill or share not found. `409` share already paid with a different key.

#### `GET /api/homes/:homeId/balances`

- Success: `200` `{ balances: [{ memberId, name, outstandingCents }] }`
- Errors: `404` home not found

**Rules**

- **Split.** A bill is split between all members of the home. The shares always add up to `totalCents`. If the amount does not divide evenly, the extra cents go to the members one by one, in the order the members were added to the home. Example: 1000 cents between 3 members gives `334`, `333`, `333`.
- **Pay.** Paying marks one share as paid and sets `paidAt`. If the same `Idempotency-Key` is sent again for the same share, answer `200` with the same result. Do not pay twice. If two requests pay the same share at the same time, only one may succeed.
- **Balances.** `outstandingCents` is the sum of the member's unpaid shares, across all bills of the home. List the members in the order they were added.

Visible tests: `api/test/bills.test.ts` and `api/test/payments.test.ts`.

#### Web page

Build one page that:

- shows the bills of a home and the shares of each bill,
- lets a member pay a share,
- shows clear **loading**, **empty**, and **error** states,
- keeps the share unpaid and shows an error if the payment fails.

The page must not crash when the API answers with an error or is slow.

## Cases you must handle

You must handle these cases and talk about them in your video:

1. A home with no members.
2. An amount that is zero, negative, or not a whole number.
3. An amount that does not divide evenly.
4. The same payment request sent twice.
5. Two members paying the same share at the same time.
6. A bill or share that does not exist.
7. The API answers with a 500 error or is slow. The web page must not crash.

## Run it

This is a pnpm workspace. Install once at the root.

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev          # api on :8787 and web on :5173
```

Open http://localhost:5173. The starter page shows a title. `/api/health` returns `{ "status": "ok" }`.

```bash
pnpm test         # run the visible tests in api/test
pnpm check        # Biome: format and lint. Must pass.
pnpm check:fix    # fix what Biome can fix
pnpm typecheck    # tsc on both packages. Must pass.
pnpm build        # production build of the web app
```

`pnpm dev` applies your migrations to a local database before it starts the API.

If pnpm says some build scripts were ignored, run `pnpm approve-builds` and allow `esbuild` and `workerd`.

When you change `api/wrangler.jsonc`, refresh the `Env` types:

```bash
pnpm --filter bill-splitter-api cf-typegen
```

## Rules for the tests

- The visible tests are in `api/test`. They start with a failing result. Your job is to make them pass.
- Do **not** change the visible tests or `api/test/helpers.ts`. We compare them with the original.
- We run extra tests after you submit. They test the cases in "Cases you must handle" more closely.

## AI policy

You can use AI tools. Tell us which ones and where in your answers on the form.
You must understand every line you submit. We check this with your video and in a live call. "The AI wrote it" is not an answer.

## How to submit

1. Click **Use this template**, then **Create a new repository**. Make the repository **public**.
2. Build your solution in your new repository. Small, clear commits are welcome.
3. Update this README with a short section called **Decisions**. Write 3 decisions you made and why.
4. Record a video of **3 minutes or less** (Loom or unlisted YouTube). Show the architecture, the data flow, and one trade-off you made. Make sure anyone with the link can view it.
5. Paste the repository link and the video link in the application form.

We will run `pnpm install && pnpm check && pnpm typecheck && pnpm test` on your repository.

## Decisions

### 1. Deterministic Member Ordering & Exact Integer Splitting

- **Decision:** Home members are ordered strictly by SQLite's internal insertion sequence (`ORDER BY rowid ASC`). The bill split algorithm uses purely integer arithmetic: `base = Math.floor(totalCents / N)` with `totalCents % N` extra pennies assigned to the first members in that insertion order.
- **Why:** In automated test runs or rapid successive API calls, timestamp precision (`datetime('now')`) can collide within the same millisecond. Relying on `rowid` guarantees a strictly monotonic sequence representing the exact order members joined. Using whole integer cents guarantees zero floating-point rounding errors and ensures shares always sum precisely to `totalCents`.

### 2. Atomic Idempotent Payments via Conditional UPDATE

- **Decision:** The payment endpoint executes an atomic conditional SQL statement:
  `UPDATE shares SET paid_at = ?, idempotency_key = ? WHERE id = ? AND bill_id = ? AND paid_at IS NULL`.
- **Why:** By combining the state check (`paid_at IS NULL`) and state mutation into a single statement, concurrent payments for the same share are serialized safely at the database engine level without needing distributed locks. If `meta.changes === 1`, the caller succeeded. If `meta.changes === 0`, we query the record: matching keys receive an idempotent `200` with the recorded `paidAt` timestamp, whereas conflicting keys receive `409 Conflict`.

### 3. Database Constraints for Defense-in-Depth

- **Decision:** We declared named table constraints in `0001_init.sql`, including:
  - `chk_bills_total_positive`: `CHECK (total_cents > 0)`
  - `chk_shares_amount_positive`: `CHECK (amount_cents > 0)`
  - `uq_shares_bill_member`: `UNIQUE (bill_id, member_id)`
  - `fk_members_home_id`, `fk_bills_home_id`, `fk_shares_bill_id`, `fk_shares_member_id`: Foreign key cascades.
- **Why:** Validation in the API route handler is essential for user-friendly error messages (e.g. 422), but application-level checks alone can fail during race conditions or direct database modifications. Enforcing constraints at the database engine level ensures invalid states (such as duplicate member shares on a single bill or negative dollar amounts) can never corrupt the storage layer under any circumstance.
